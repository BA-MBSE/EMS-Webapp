# angular-mms â€” angular module that contains core services, directives, filters

This is modified from the angular-seed project and added grunt tasks


## Files

The mms module sources are in src/. app/ contains an application that uses mms module just for testing out things and experimenting with how actual apps would use mms services and directives.


## Building and Running

* (install node.js and grunt)
* cd into angular-mms root dir
* npm install - install all node modules needed to run tasks
* grunt - default task - this will do jshint on all sources inside src/, concat them into dist/mms.js, run jshint on that, minify into dist/mms.min.js, and copy whats in app/ and dist/ into build/
* grunt server - does the default, plus runs a webserver at localhost:9000 and a proxy server that proxies to sheldon for any path starting with /alfresco. This allows us to test with real service endpoint
* grunt server:stub - does the same thing as grunt server except the proxy is to a local stub server, can mock alfresco service api with stubby configurations in rest/
* grunt clean - deletes dist and build folders

## Testing
TBD - the angular-seed project contains test scripts using karma, jasmine and protractor - need to figure out how to run tests on our src

## Generating Docs
* grunt ngdocs - this would generate html docs based on code comments written in ngdocs style into docs/. Something's wrong right now with the main page but the individual service pages seem to be generated correctly
